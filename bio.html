                <p>I am a computer engineering student at northwesrern university. I am now actively seeking for entry level software engineer opportunities. </p>
                <p>This summer, I interned as a software engineer at snips media in Chicago and developed a tool to create photo/video collections, associating products which fans can purchase directly through the web/mobile app. During this internship, I become interested in developing scalable back-end software applications. I studied Electrical engineering in the U.K., and transfer to computer engineering when I come to NU&#128156;, so I have experience across many fields, includes full stack development, distributed system, machine learning and Microprocessor based IOT system.</p>
